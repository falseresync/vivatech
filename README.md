## Power grid

Fiddle with a realistic(-ish!) power grid! No energy storage to speak of; balance generation
and demand to keep your devices functional or risk getting in trouble!

## Gadget

Use your gadget - it is quite a useful tool that allows you to pass energy through focuses to create many
desirable effects!

#### Starshooter focus

Have you ever wanted to shoot stars at your enemies? Now you can! 
Stars explode your enemy, but don't explode blocks (a.k.a. building-safe :D)

#### Lightning focus

Now, how about playing a Zeus? You can do that with Lightning focus! 
For some charge you can easily shoot lightning left and right!

#### Comet Warp focus

Everyone has to venture into a crowd of enemies sometimes. Or to just teleport home without hassle. 
Use the nifty Comet Warp focus to setup a recall point and then teleport to it from any location 
or dimension for just some wand charge!

#### Energy Veil focus

Just because you don't have armor, doesn't mean you can't have protection! Use this focus to create a barrier
made of concentrated energy panels around yourself which will repel projectiles and any nasties coming your way!
Be careful not to use up all your charge though :)
