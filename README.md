## Power grid

Fiddle with a realistic(-ish!) power grid! No energy storage to speak of; balance generation
and demand to keep your devices functional or risk getting in trouble!

#### Wires

Wires are the core of your Grid! Use Wire to connect wire posts, and voila - it transfers electricity. But be mindful - you need way more than just one wire to connect far away points. And you can of course use pliers to cut connections.

#### Heaters

Heaters are nifty machines that allow you to save up on fuel, or even go full renewable :) Connect them to the grid and you can heat up nearby furnaces without any coal!

#### Probe

A probe is your best friend in troubleshooting the system, as well as preventing catastrophic failures. Use it to measure Voltage and Current on a Wire post and see if it matches your expectations

#### Wind turbines

To generate power you can use Wind turbines - place a Gearbox (You wouldn't want the veeery slow wind to cut your electricity supply, would you?), attach a Turbine, and behind the Gearbox place a Generator.

and [Bluberry-Kat](https://kat.blue)

The current version has been built with the help of great people at the Fabric and Modfest Discord servers.
Additionally, I have used assets, libraries and pieces of code by these wonderful people and projects:

- [Some item textures](https://pixerelia.itch.io/vas-basic-spells-and-buffs) by Atelier Pixeleria @ itch.io
- [Some GUI/HUD textures](https://bdragon1727.itch.io/basic-pixel-health-bar-and-scroll-bar) by BDragon1727 @ itch.io
- [Some item & GUI/HUD textures](https://devillas.itch.io/mystic-rpg-icon-pack) by Devillas @ itch.io
- Some item and block textures from the [original legacy Vivatech](https://github.com/CottonMC/Vivatech)
  & [Cotton Resources](https://github.com/CottonMC/CottonResources) mods by the Cotton team
- [jGraphT](https://jgrapht.org/) library that enables the power grid to actually exist xD
- [Some classes and tidbits of code](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib) are taken from owo-lib
- And finally, there are also acknowledgements in the code for the times
  I needed to use code from StackOverflow and Wiki lol
